# Advent of Code 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, a series of programming puzzles released every December as a fun way to practice coding skills.

## 📅 Challenges

Advent of Code provides a new challenge each day from **December 1st to December 25th**. Each challenge consists of two parts, with the second part unlocking after completing the first.

## 🤪 Why Am I Doing This?
Advent of Code is a fun way to practice problem-solving skills, learn new programming languages, and connect with other developers. I'm participating in this event to challenge myself, improve my coding skills, and have fun solving puzzles.
